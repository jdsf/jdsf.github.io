                <strong>Silencing the Man, 03/26 </strong> – <br><br> This is an idea I had some years ago and
                I keep coming back to. Construction, especially in
                swiftly proliferating, highly urban, dense cities such as Seattle
                 is a daily fixture of life. Cranes, construction zones,
                big cement mixer trucks are all widely seen… and heard!
                 Construction is a highly noisy endeavor and there probably
                are public regulations regarding the times and places and noise
                 levels which are appropriate. Still, wouldn’t it be great if all
                those sounds were better muffled? There may be a large untapped market
                in producing muffling materials and deployable surfaces for
                construction applications. Imagine coating a jackhammer with a
                composite that dampens sound? What if there were deployable sound proofing
                textiles that lined construction site walls and which decreased the
                 sound intensity of things enclosed by them? I imagine there
                must already be work going into this... perhaps it is difficult and
                expensive to create such material that is both flexible, easily
                deployable, resistant, and inexpensive enough. Still, imagine the
                news that something like a completely silent or minimally noisy
                construction operation would garner! Any company offering such
                services at affordable prices would leave any competition out to hang.

                <strong>Out of Key, 03/27</strong> – <br><br>I forgot the key to my
                 apartment… wouldn’t it be great if doorlocks had some kind of
                mechanically didactic component to them which completely obviated
                the use of a key? The key would be none other than a specific
                mechanical conformation on the face of the door (which you could set
                 yourself). This could work very much like the way some smartphones
                 secure their screen;  i.e.  patterns you can draw with your
                 finger. This may be accomplished through a
                 preset mechanical surface composed of rolling spheres and joints
                 which turn and slide in response to pressure. This may be less practical
                than carrying keys if the puzzle is large
                and takes too long to input… however if enough complexity
                can be added to a small puzzle such that it is difficult
                to brute-force while still allowing dexterous development of
                muscle memory, then this may catch on! Learning it once
                might mean never forgetting keys again, barring any amnesia event.
                Plus since the "locking pattern" can be changed by the user, changing
                locks would not require buying a whole new set!

                <strong>Nature's Requite, 03/29 </strong> – <br><br>There is a
                <a href="https://i.imgur.com/D6rWksk.gifv" target="_blank">video</a>
                circulating the web where some people in Liantang Village,
                Shenzen, China, are seen mesmerized, pointing smartphone cameras at
                something out of frame. The camera pans right and reveals a building.
                The camera pans upwards and reveals the building’s walls flush with
                a richly reddish-pink flower in bloom. It seems some kind of vine
                (maybe a Bougainvillea) made its way and covered the whole
                building; Leaving an incredibly pleasing view... a breath of fresh air
                amidst the drab monotony that characterizes cities. What if more
                buildings were covered by flowers/plants? Choosing the appropriate
                plants for the climate and architecture could be a stylistic and
                environmental choice. Buildings could be designed with these
                in mind, allowing for complex and beautiful growing patterns.
                Plus, if tenants or specialized companies do well in
                maintaining/scaping the greenery then windows and doors
                could remain functional, cleanly accentuated by natural
                foliage. I hope this is the future of cities, a revival
                of more natural historical roots, an embracing endemic
               flora in the name of aesthetics and environmental consciousness.</span>
