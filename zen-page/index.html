                Ryōkan Taigu (良寛大愚) (1758–1831) was a quiet and eccentric
                Sōtō Zen Buddhist monk who lived much of his life as a hermit.

                Ryōkan spent much of his time writing poetry, doing calligraphy,
                and communing with nature. His poetry is often very simple and
                inspired by nature. He loved children, and sometimes forgot to
                beg for food because he was playing with the children of the
                nearby village. Ryōkan refused to accept any position as a
                priest or even as a "poet." In the tradition of Zen his quotes
                and poems show he had a good sense of humour and didn't take
                himself too seriously.

                Ryōkan was born Eizō Yamamoto (山本栄蔵 Yamamoto Eizō) in the
                village of Izumozaki in Echigo Province (now Niigata Prefecture)
                in Japan to the village headman. He renounced the world at an
                early age to train at nearby Sōtō Zen temple Kōshō-ji, refusing
                to meet with or accept charity from his family. Once the Zen
                master Kokusen visited the temple, and Ryōkan was deeply
                impressed with his demeanor. He solicited permission to
                become Kokusen's disciple. Kokusen accepted, and the two
                returned to Entsū-ji monastery in Tamashima (now Okayama
                Prefecture).

                In 1826 Ryōkan became ill and was unable to continue living as
                a hermit. He moved into the house of one of his patrons, Kimura
                 Motouemon, and was cared for by a young nun called Teishin.
                 "The [first] visit left them both exhilarated, and led to a
                 close relationship that brightened Ryōkan's final years".
                The two of them exchanged a series of haiku. The poems they
                exchanged are both lively and tender. Ryōkan died from his
                illness on the 6th day of the new year 1831. "Teishin records
                that Ryōkan, seated in meditation posture, died 'just as if
                he were falling asleep'".

                On his deathbed, Ryōkan offered the following death poem to
                Teishin:
              </span>

                Now it reveals its hidden side <br>
                and now the other—thus it falls, <br>
